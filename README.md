Old releases of Multigraph in a github repo, for hosting on github pages.

The gh-pages branch of this repo contains files that will appear at 
http://multigraph.github.com/archive.  That URL looks like it's part
of the same site as http://multigraph.github.com, but it's managed
separately in this repo, in order to keep the size of the down.

To add files to the archive, commit them to the gh-pages branch of this
repo, update the index.html file, and push to github.  The result
will show up at http://multigraph.github.com/archive.
